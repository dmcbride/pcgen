# Class Name				Hit Dice	Type			Abbreviation	Max Level	Save checks bonus															Combat bonus					SOURCELONG
#
#War wizards of Evermeet are specially trained wizards to project Evermeet 
#power back onto the mainland.  Their presence in a single location does no
#mean Evermeet is at war with that location, nor are the wizards necessarily 
#diplomats for Evermeet (although they may have to fill in for that role from 
#time to time).
#
#Requirements:
#Race: Elf
#Skills: Knowledge (Evermeet) 4, Knowledge (Arcana) 8, Diplomacy 4, Spellcraft 
#10
#Feats: Scribe Scroll, Empower Spell
#Spellcasting: ability to cast 3rd-level arcane spells
#Special: must be a citizen of Evermeet - this doesn't mean you must live 
#there, just that the Evermeet government recognises you as a citizen.

#
# Class Name				Skill Pts/Lvl	Class Skill
#1 - Membership, Improved spell acquisition
#2 - Access to Evermeet portals, Spell pool I
#3 - Bonus archery feat
#4 - Elven Low Magic - Automatic Empower Spell
#5 - Bonus metamagic or spell focus feat
#6 - Spell pool II
#7 - Improved Empower
#8 - Bonus archery feat
#9 - Bonus metamagic or spell focus feat
#10 - Spell pool III
#
#Membership - you become a full member of the guild. Dues are 25gp per month, 
#payable up to 1 year in advance; obedience to the rulings of the guild 
#masters; obedience to the rulings of Evermeet's proper and popular 
#government.
#
#Access to Evermeet portals - As part of your training, you learn the keys and 
#passphrases to enter Evermeet via portals. To recall the passphrase, a DC15 
#Guild Wizard of Evermeet level check, with INT bonus is required. To recall 
#if there is an accessible Evermeet-owned portal within a 50-mile radius of 
#your current position requires a DC20 survival check.
#This does not necessarily allow others to go through the portal, too.
#Non-citizens still need permission to enter Evermeet, especially non-elves.
#
#Improved spell acquisition - At each level of advancement in the guild 
#prestige class, a character gains three spells of her choice of any level she 
#can cast to add to her spell book.
#
#Spell pool - see the spell pool description in Magic of Faerun (p19).
#You gain access to levels 1-3 at level 2, and add 4-6 at level 6, and 7-9 at
#level 10.
#
#Bonus archery feat - at third and eighth levels, the character may select any 
#archery feat to complement their already innate abilities as an archer. You 
#must still meet the prerequisites for gaining the feat. e.g., point blank 
#shot.
#
#Automatic Empower Spell - at fourth level, the character may empower spells 
#not prepared for extending at time of casting without increasing the level of 
#the spell slot.  This is usable 3 times per day.
#
#Improved Empower Spell - at 7th level, the empower feat, including the 
#automatic empower, can be used to double the variable aspects of your spell 
#rather than just 50% extra.
